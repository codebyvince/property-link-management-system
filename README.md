# 🏡 Property Link Management System (PLMS)

PLMS is a project I’m building to solve a real problem in the real estate market:  
**how do you connect people to the right property faster, safer, and with a better experience?**

This system lets property owners list rentals, houses, event spaces, and even grounds for hire —  
while giving clients a smooth way to browse, filter, and book what they’re looking for.

## ✨ Features (so far)
- Secure sign up/login with role-based access  
- Property listings with images, pricing, and amenities  
- Smart search + filters (location, price range, type)  
- User dashboard for owners, clients, and admin  
- (Planned) AI-based recommendations + virtual tours

## 🚀 Why I’m building this
I’ve always been inspired by how **technology can simplify big markets** like real estate.  
PLMS is my way of experimenting with:
- **Modern web design**  
- **Secure systems**  
- **Interactive features** tailored for the Kenyan real estate market (and beyond).  

This is was part of my academic project, but I’m pushing it further to feel like a real product.
